## What we will cover

<Steps>


- What to test for both new components and old code
- The general approach and philosophy of testing
- Some nifty tips and tricks to make testing less daunting
- Discuss next steps as a team

</Steps>

## What to test

<Steps>


- New components!
  - But what does testing mean? What behavior do I test??
- Old components!
  - But what if they don't have tests?
  - Or if they have old crufty enzyme tests?
- What about API calls? Or big components with lots of children?

</Steps>


<Notes>


- This is "unit-ish" testing
- User-centric testing
- Don't go down a rabbit hole

</Notes>


---

## New components

<Steps>


- TDD?
- If it makes sense!
- Snapshots?
- Acceptable, but usually there's a better assertion.

</Steps>


<Notes>


- Sometimes TDD doesn't vibe with the way we program
- Testing after that implementation can be a sort of "proof"

</Notes>


---

### Example:

```jsx
<FuelSurchargeTableCriteriaForm />
```

<Notes>


- Wrote tests after implementation
- Hard to write react-select _unit_ tests
  - cypress can help with that!
- Additional required fields
- Mode and equipment fetching
  - Mock, reset

</Notes>


---

### Older code

<Steps>


- Don't stress!
- This is iterative
- Can we migrate from enzyme to testing-library for this component?
- Can we write _new_ tests using testing-library?

</Steps>


---

### Example:

```js
withStatusToasts(Component);
```

<Notes>


- Migrate to testing-library
- Assert using screen

</Notes>

## Testing philosophy

Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration.

https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests

The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.

## Next steps

<Steps>


- Pair programming for test-writing
- Accessibility and roles for components
  - E.g. titles for buttons, properly-related labels for inputs
- Custom/bespoke test utils for
  - redux tests,
  - mocking setup, and
  - other boilerplate
- Making tests part of our review process

</Steps>
