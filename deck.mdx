## What to test

<Steps>


- New components!
  - But what does testing mean? What behavior do I test??
- Old components!
  - But what if they don't have tests?
  - Or if they have old crufty enzyme tests?
- What about API calls? Or big components with lots of children?

</Steps>


<Notes>


- This is "unit-ish" testing
- User-centric testing
- Don't go down a rabbit hole

</Notes>

## New components

<Steps>


- TDD?
- If it makes sense!

</Steps>


<Notes>


- Sometimes TDD doesn't vibe with the way we program
- Testing after that implementation can be a sort of "proof"

</Notes>

### Example:

```jsx
<FuelSurchargeTableCriteriaForm />
```

<Notes>


- Wrote tests after implementation
- Hard to write react-select _unit_ tests
  - cypress can help with that!
- Additional required fields
- Mode and equipment fetching
  - Mock, reset

</Notes>
